# SimBox: Your Interactive Simulation Sandbox

Welcome to SimBox! A dynamic, web-based application built with Next.js that provides a collection of interactive "Explorers" for visualizing and experimenting with various systems and algorithms. Dive in and explore complex concepts in an intuitive and hands-on way.

## üöÄ About The Project

SimBox was created to make learning and experimentation more accessible and engaging. Instead of just reading about complex topics, SimBox allows you to see them in action. Whether you're a student, a professional, or just a curious mind, you can tweak parameters, run simulations, and gain a deeper understanding of the underlying principles at play.

### Key Features

*   **Interactive Visualizations**: Watch simulations unfold in real-time.
*   **Configurable Parameters**: Adjust variables to see how they affect the outcome.
*   **Multiple "Explorers"**: Dedicated modules for different domains like **mathematics, physics, and chemistry**.
*   **Web-Based**: No installation required. Access it from any modern browser.
*   **Built with Next.js**: A fast, modern, and responsive user experience.

## üß≠ Meet the Explorers

The core of SimBox is its collection of Explorers. Each one is a self-contained module designed to simulate a specific set of phenomena across different scientific disciplines.

## üìñ Usage Guide

Getting started with SimBox as a user is simple.

1.  **Navigate to the App**: Open the deployed URL for the SimBox application in your web browser.
2.  **Select an Explorer**: From the main dashboard or navigation menu, choose the Explorer you are interested in (e.g., "Projectile Motion Simulator").
3.  **Configure Parameters**: On the Explorer's page, you will see a control panel. Use the sliders, input fields, and buttons to set up the initial conditions for your simulation. For example, you might set the `initial velocity`, `launch angle`, or `mass of celestial bodies`.
4.  **Run the Simulation**: Click the "Start" or "Run" button to begin the simulation.
5.  **Observe and Interact**: Watch the visualization canvas. Many explorers allow you to interact while the simulation is running, such as by adding new elements or dragging objects.
6.  **Reset and Experiment**: Use the "Reset" or "Clear" button to start over. Try different parameters to see how your changes impact the results!
